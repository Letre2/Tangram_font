We built a modular typography using the P5.js and GSAP libraries. The project was inspired by the Chinese puzzle game "Tangram".

In order not to have to redefine all geometric shapes every time,
we decided to use classes. Just like
Javascript objects, Javascript classes can hold properties as well as functions / methods.
as well as functions / methods. The class acts as a
template. By calling the class and naming the properties,
methods or functions, new objects can be created.
In our code this happens in the setup function.

The seven, geometric shapes are initially drawn on the origin of the coordinate system. By passing the tX and tY values from the "CreateLetters" function, the same shapes are moved together on the canvas. From there they are moved individually by the "x" and "y" values from the "letters.js" file, and rotated by the value "r".
